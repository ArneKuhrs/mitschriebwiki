== Computer from '98 ==

 I got my first real own PC - got it from my aunty Cate
 Her husband had no use for it - was my birthday of '98
 Me and my brothers then - plugged it in and it starts to boot
 Hard drive spins and LEDs were blinking - installed some games to run and shoot
 
 Oh when I look at it - the computer seems to stick to me
 But if I had the money - ya I'd order a new PC
 This computer gets me on my nerves.
 
 Ain't no use in complaining - when you gotta slow machine
 Spent my free time here at the display - playing with Guy and Keen  - ya
 Progress bars slowly filling - That told me that I'd wait forever
 And when the loading ends - I got the antique gameing fever
 Tetris was the best game I could play - oh year - on my computer from '98
 
 Man we were killing foes
   we were jump-and-running - we needn't to upgrade
 I guess this box I'll got forever... (forever...)
 
 Since then the times were changin'
 Look at what the others got and sold
 Sometimes when I crash my old machine 
 I think about it wonder will it hold?
 
 Progress bars slowly fillin' - that told me that I'd wait forever
 And when the loading ends - I got the antique gameing fever
 Those were the best games I could play - on my computer from '98
