 e-mail, e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 Type it and e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 
 Why should I worry
 Where my cell phone I did put
 It's not the only way
 That I contact home
 You talk so shrilly
 I like to hear you not
 So why should I pick up the phone
 
 As far as I can tell
 You write so well
 I think always
 At the end of the lett'r
 You could have said it
 And I would get it
 Though mailing is
 Always better
 
 At first, my friend
 I'll never gonna miss your e- mail
 But sooner or later
 I'll put you on my kill file
 And won't tell you 'bout it!
 
 e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 It's eazy: e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 
 We love to read the spam
 We love to pass it on
 Though you tried to
 Filter all of it out
 But with all my skill
 Your folder will fill
 So tomorrow it'll be floating out
 All saying:
 
 At first, my friend
 I'll never gonna miss your e- mail
 But sooner or later
 I'll put you on my spam list
 And won't tell you, fool!
 
 e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 Type it and e-mail
 I'm on the net, fool,
 e-mail
 Why don't you e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 
 Just try it: e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 e-mail to the world
