/zur Melodie von Uriah Heeps "Free Me". Bitte nicht ändern./

 e-mail, e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 Type it and e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 
 Why should I worry
 Where my cell phone I did put
 It's not the only way
 That I contact home
 You talk so shrilly
 I like to hear you not
 So why should I pick up the phone
 
 As far as I can tell
 You write so well
 I think always
 At the end of the lett'r
 You could have said it
 And I would get it
 Though mailing is
 Always better
 
 At first, stupid flamer
 I'll never gonna miss your mail
 But sooner or later
 I'll put you on my kill file
 And won't tell you 'bout it!
 
 e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 It's eazy: e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 
 We love to read the spam
 We love to pass it on
 Though you tried to
 Filter all of it out
 But with all my skill
 Your folder will fill
 So tomorrow it'll be floating out
 All saying:
 
 At first, stupid flamer
 I'll never gonna miss your mail
 But sooner or later
 I'll put you on my kill file
 And won't tell you, fool!
 
 e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 Type it and e-mail
 I'm on the net, fool,
 e-mail
 Why don't you e-mail
 e-mail to the world
 
 Just try it: e-mail
 Why don't just e-mail
 Type it and e-mail
 e-mail to the world

 Free me, free me
 Why won't you free me
 Free me from your spell
 Come on and free me
 Why won't you free me
 Come on and free me
 Free me from your spell

 Why should I worry
 That you might not love me
 You're not the only love
 That I've ever had
 Your sweet memory
 Will always comfort me
 So why should I be feeling sad

 As far as I can tell
 You knew so well
 I was always
 At the end of the line
 I've loved you as much
 As any man can
 But not enough
 To make you mine

 So long, easy rider
 I know I'll miss you for awhile
 But sooner or later
 I know that I'll forget you
 And I tell you babe

 Free me
 Come on and free me
 Why won't you free me
 Free me from your spell
 Oh babe, free me
 Why won't you free me
 Come on and free me
 Free me from your spell

 We let a good love die
 We let it pass us by
 Though you tried to
 Keep me hangin' on
 But with all this doubt
 It'll never work out
 So tomorrow I'll be travellin' on
 And saying:

 So long, easy rider
 I know I'll miss you for awhile
 But sooner or later
 I know that I'll forget you
 And I beg it babe

 Free me
 Come on and free me
 Why won't you free me
 Free me from your spell
 Come on and free me
 I'm on my knees, babe
 Free me
 Why won't you free me
 Free me from your spell

 Oh babe, come on
 Come on and free me
 Why won't you free me
 Free me from this spell
