== She's the 1 ==

(zur Melodie von "She's the one" von Robbie Williams)

 "I" was her	back in Rome
 But she's 1	here at home
   And if there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
   If there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
 
 She and oh's	all you need
 to work in	binary
   And if there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
   If there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
 
 When you take some to what you got
 And want to know what's in the set
   You're adding
 When you write her left on the row
 And then one thousand times "zero"
   That'll be to hight, that's mind-boggling
 
 Facutly 	might be strong
 But 1 !		that's just 1
   And if there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
   If there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
 
 When you take some to what you got
 And want to know what's in the set
   You're adding
 When you write her left on the row
 And then one thousand times 0
   That'll be to hight, that's mind-boggling
 
 "I" was her	back in Rome
 But she's 1	here at home
   And if there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
   If there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
 
   If there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
   Yeah she's the 1
 
   If there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
   She's the 1.
 
   If there's a number
   Times n is n,
   She's the 1.
