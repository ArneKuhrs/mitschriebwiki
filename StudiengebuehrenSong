== Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm <li>or</li> The Studiengebühren-Song ==

(Sung to the melody of "Mmm Mmm Mmm" by the Crash Test Dummies)

 Once, there was this boy who
 Woudn't got to class and woudn't read the books
 But when he took the exam
 He failed and had to do the course once more
 He finished after ten years
 And now he's got the Pulitzer
 
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
 
 And then, there was this girl who
 Would do nothing but study and learn all the day
 She wished that she could party
 But she just didn't really have a live
 She had to finish real quick
 Because her parents said so
 
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
 
 But both girl and boy were glad
 'Cause one kid had it worse than that
 
 'Cause then, there was this boy who
 Really got the stuff it takes to be a scientist
 And if he just had his chance
 He might have found a way to heal the cancer
 He couldn't quite afford it
 Now he is fixing engines
 
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
 Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm
