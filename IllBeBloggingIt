== I'll be bloggin it ==

(Zur Melodie von "Every Breath You Take" von The Police)

 Every food I take
 Every noise I make
 Every car I break
 Every lie I stake
 I'll be blogging it
 
 Every single day
 Every word I say
 Every game I play
 Every cent I pay
 Ill be blogging it
 
 Oh can't you read
 What's on my feed
 How my weblog grows
 As the net time flows
 
 Every meme I take
 Every cake I bake
 Every noise I make
 Every track back fake
 I'll be blogging it
 
 Since I blog I never live without a trace
 I type at night I will win the weblog race
 I look real nice but just on my planet face
 I feel so hyped and as long as that's the case
 I keep blogging today today please...
 
 Oh can't you read
 What's on my feed
 How my weblog grows
 As the net time flows
 
 Every food I take
 Every lawn I rake
 Every cake I bake
 Every car I break
 I'll be blogging it

 Every swim I lake
 Every song I make
 I'll be blogging it

 I'll be blogging it
 I'll be blogging it
 I'll be blogging it
 I'll be blogging it
