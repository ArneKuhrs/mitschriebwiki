=== Wrote it in Haskell ===
(/Zur Meldoie von "Cats in the Cradle", oder noch besser, zu "Cats in the Kettle". Bitte nicht Ã¤ndern./)

 Our new semester, it has just begun,
 And it did seem to me  like it would bring some fun.
 Then we met Calmet  and the way he spoke
 That's not German 'cause his German is broke
 Seems to me that if I want to get along
 I get used to his tongue.  I learn to hear his tongue.
 
 So I wrote it in Haskell in the dark pool room
 It is night and I type and I toil here since noon.
 I got no variables and it freaks me out
 But I can do without
 Somehow I can do without.
 
 Once I did that job,  had to code that thing,
 And they left me the choice  what I would code it in.
 My buffers overflow'd  when I was using C
 Slowest language there is: That's PHP
 Java's bloated VM always got me stuck
 I'm too dumb for brainfuck, I wish I'd use brainfuck
 
 [Refrain]
