=== Fifty ways to bug your users ===

/Zur Melodie von "50 Ways to leave your lover" von Paul Simon/

 "It's boring all inside my head" I said to me
 The answer is easy if you are immorally
 I'd like to watch them in their struggle to work here
 There must be fifty ways to bug your users
 
 I said it's really not my habit to intrude
 Furthermore, I hope my mean tricks won't be bad or misconstrued
 But I'll do it again at the risk of being sued
 There must be fifty ways to bug your users
 Fifty ways to bug your users
 
 
 Just just pull out the plug, Zack
 Pour out a can, Stan
 You don't need to back up, Chap
 Just having some fun
 Overclocked bus, Gus
 You don't need to restart, Mart
 Just drop of the net, Pete
 And for me it's fun
 
 Just just pull out the plug, Zack
 Pour out a can, Stan
 You don't need to back up, Chap
 Just having some fun
 Overclocked bus, Gus
 You don't need to restart, Mart
 Just drop of the net, Pete
 And for me it's fun
 
 
 Some admins hate it to see users in such pain
 I wish there was something I could do to see it once again
 My boss don't appreciate that and I always explain
 About the fifty ways
 
 He said "Why do I not just fire you tonight
 And I believe in the morning we'll begin to see the light"
 And then I told him and he realized I would go with a fight
 Since there are Fifty ways to hurt your users
 Fifty ways to hurt your users
 
 
 Just just pull out the plug, Zack
 Pour out a can, Stan
 You don't need to back up, Chap
 Just having some fun
 Overclocked bus, Gus
 You don't need to restart, Mart
 Just drop of the net, Pete
 And for me it's fun
 
 Just just pull out the plug, Zack
 Pour out a can, Stan
 You don't need to back up, Chap
 Just having some fun
 Overclocked bus, Gus
 You don't need to restart, Mart
 Just drop of the net, Pete
 And for me it's fun
