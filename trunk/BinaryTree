== Binary Tree ==

(zur Melodie von "Lemon Tree" von Fool's Garden)

 I'm waiting here for some one to search
 It's just no problem to find every wanted branch
 I'm wasting your RAM
 I am such a bad case
 I want you to come
 And start using that space
 And nothing ever matches  when I'm searching 
 
 I'm searching around in my root
 I'm searching real fast
 I'm searching real good
 I'm one big fat memory hog
 I'm feeling balanced, I'm faster than log
 And nothing ever matches  so I'm searching 

 I search my left
 I search my right
 Make me search it and I search recursively
 Since all I really am is just another bin'ry tree.
 I'm crawling my nodes up and down
 I'm crawling crawling crawling crawling crawling around
 And all I really am is just another bin'ry tree.

 (Sing: dubdadidadab...)

 I'm sitting here
 I miss the data
 I'd like to have more, growing big later
 But theres a lot to care  before "insert"
 You need the spot
 Where the thing fits right in.
 And nothing ever matches  so I'm searching 

 Balancation is real good for me
 Balancation: I'm now faster 'cause I'm a bin'ry tree.

 I'm starting to search  at the top node of me
 User anyhow I'll find it in this tree
 And everything will be there and you'll find it

 You'll find it left
 You'll find it right
 Make me search it and I search recursively
 Since all I really am is just a balanced bin'ry tree.
 I'm crawling my nodes up and down
 I'm crawling crawling crawling crawling crawling around
 And all I really am is just a balanced bin'ry tree.
 And I'm searching searching

 I search my left
 I search my right
 Make me search it and I search recursively
 Since all I really am  Since all I really am  Since all I really am 
 is just a balanced bin'ry tree.
