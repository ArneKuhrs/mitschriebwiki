== Summer as a Student ==

(Zur Melodie von "Summer in the City" / Uni ist Deutsch auszusprechen)

 Hot air  summer at the uni
 Top of my head  my sweat is getting eeky
 Sit here  isn't it a pity
 Wish I could go out  and not work for the uni
 
 All around,  people having great fun
 Playing on the sidewalk  playing in the hot sun

     And at night it's no different world
     Sit here read word by word
     Come-on come-on and learn all night
     Despite the heat better work alright

     And hey, don't you know its a pity
     The tests can't be easy stuff
     In the summer, at the uni
     In the summer, at the uni
 
 Sit down, evening full of study
 Working so hard and feeling so silly
 Sit there, subject's really shitty
 Wish I wouldn't have to learn and read and study

 Head is feeling like a war game
 Skimming through the books  gonna know it as my own name
 
     And at night it's no different world
     Sit here read word by word
     Come-on come-on and learn all night
     Despite the heat better work alright

     And hey, don't you know its a pity
     The tests can't be easy stuff
     In the summer, at the uni
     In the summer, at the uni

 Hot air  summer at the uni
 Top of my head  my sweat is getting eeky
 Sit here  isn't it a pity
 Wish I could go out  and not work for the uni
 
 All around,  people having great fun
 Playing on the sidewalk  playing in the hot sun

     And at night it's no different world
     Sit here read word by word
     Come-on come-on and learn all night
     Despite the heat better work alright

     And hey, don't you know its a pity
     The tests can't be easy stuff
     In the summer, at the uni
     In the summer, at the uni
