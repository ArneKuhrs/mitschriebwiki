== Ain't Not Chatting  /or/  The ICQ Song ==

(zur Meldoie von "Ain't No Sunshine" von Bill Withers)

Gedwidmet all jenen, deren Internetverbindung
nicht zuverl√§ssig genug arbeitet.
 

 Ain't no chatting when it's down
 I'm not on when it turns off
 Ain't not chatting when it's down
 And it's always down so long
 Anytime it goes off line
 
 Wonder this time why it's down
 Wonder if they'll get it fixed
 Ain't no chatting when it's down
 And the net just can't reach home
 Anytime it goes off line
 
 And I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait,
 I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait,
 I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait,
 I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait,
 I wait, I wait, I wait
 
 (Hey, I ought to call them on the phone)
 Since I'm not chatting when it's down
 Ain't no chatting when it's down
 Only fan noise all the day
 Ain't no chatting when it's down
 And the net just can't reach home
 Anytime it goes off line
 Anytime it goes off line
 Anytime it goes off line
 Anytime it goes off line
 Anytime it goes off line
