== Frequent Flyer ==

(Zur Melodie von „I’m on Fire“ von Bruce Springsteen)
 
 Hey little girl I will not be home
 I gotta go away and leave you all alone
 I got a bad desire:
 Oh oh oh... Frequent Flyer
 
 Air plane food, is it good to me
 Can I dare to eat the things that I see
 Gotta take me higher
 Oh oh oh... Frequent Flyer
 
 Sometimes its when someone takes a seat, right,
 Smelly and dull and talks a six-hour flight
 Through the middle of my dream.
 
 One night I touch down between ships with sails
 And a freight box running through the 
 Middle of the aisles
 I am lost, only surviver
 Oh oh oh.. Frequent Flyer
